User Story / Gameplay
    Describe the gameplay
        Two paddles are bouncing a ball back and forth.

    What are the conditions when the game begins?
        The gane begins when someone moves their paddle.

    Does the game have an end? If so, what are the conditions for when it ends?
        Yes, it ends when one player reaches 11 points (or when programmer decides to end game).

    What ifs will there be?
    If the ball cross over the board edge, then the opposite player earns a point. 

    If the ball hits a paddle, reverse the direction

    if the ball hits the botton or top of the board, reverse its direction. 

    If the player hits up or down arrow key, move the paddle in the prespective direction.
    
    if a player scores, end the game and show winner's name!

    if the ball hits one of the paddles, increase ball speed

    if the paddle hits top or bottom edge of the board, stop the paddle.

    if the ball hits board edge, return ball to middle of the board and reset the speed to starting speed. 

Visual Game Components:
    What are the visual game components? For example, in Bouncing Box, the game components were the board and the box. 
    - board w/ center line
    - two paddles 
    - ball

    Which will be static? (the board)
    the line
    the board
    game start page (can be animated)

    Which will be animated? (the box)
    ball 
    paddles
    (possibly the score board and game finish page-w/confetti)

    What data will you need to manage each game component? For example, in Bouncing Box, the data values were positionX, speedX, and points.
        positionX, positionY, speedX, speedY 

Events / Logic
    What events will occur in this game? (timer events, keyboard events, clicking events?)
        keydown
        keyup
        ball touching paddle
        (maybe spacebar event)
        (maybe a click on space bar on beginning and ending pages)
       // score board keeping track of score

    How do those events affect the data of the program?
        one player will use up and down, another will use w and s 

    for each "event", write out the high-level logic of what will happen. It is better (and tricky) to be as specific as you can while remaining high-level!
        keydown 
        
        $(document).on("keydown", handleKeyDown)
        handleKeyDown(event){
            if(event.which === key.up){
               //move paddle up
               //increase (maybe decrease top css position) positionY 
                speedX = 5;
            }
            (event.which === key.down){
                move paddle down
                adjust positionY

            }
            when the ball hits paddle(){
                change direction of ball
                then, increase speed of the ball.
            }
            if score goes up(){
                add one point
            } else {
                score stays same
            }
        }
